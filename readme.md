This is a fully functional Django-based blogging system built by Kiran Kumar, designed with real-world features in mind. It includes a clean project structure, role-based access control, admin dashboard, blog post management, categories, comments, search, and responsive UI. The project demonstrates practical Django skills such as models, forms, authentication, permissions, media handling, and template design. It serves as a great example of how to build a complete content management application using modern Django best practices.
